# CheckQCTMC
## INTRODUCTION
This project has implemented the method in our paper Checking Continuous Stochastic Logic against Quantum Continuous-Time Markov Chains.
This file describes the setup/installation proceedures for the code. 

## CONTENTS
In the directory, you should find the following files:
 - [ToMatlab.nb] - Connects to the Matlab Kernel with the Mathematic application [MATLink](http://matlink.org/).
 - [Function.nb] - Contains all the functions we use.
 - [Apollonian Network.nb] - Implement the running example Apollonian Network described in our paper.
 
## Installation
  1. You must have both Mathematica 12.0 and MATLAB software installed on your computer.
  2. Run the first three commands in *ToMatlab.nb* to get in connection with Matlab such that we can use the numeric method expm.
  3. Run all the commands in *Function.nb*.
  4. Run the commands in *Apollonian Network.nb* the results of running examples will be shown sequentially.
  5. In the end, run the last command in *ToMatlab.nb* to close the connection with Matlab.
